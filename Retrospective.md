The ONE_LINE game project was allowed me to apply modular design principles and state-based architecture using Python and Pygame. One of the most successful aspects of the project was the smooth and intuitive navigation achieved through the implementation of a GameManager to handle different game states, such as the main menu, level selection screen, and the maze gameplay. The reusable button system also proved effective, allowing for consistent UI interactions across multiple screens. The core gameplay mechanic—where players must step on every tile exactly once—functioned reliably and offered a solid puzzle experience.

However, the project also came with several challenges. Managing event handling across different game states proved tricky at first, particularly when dealing with simultaneous keyboard and mouse inputs. Bugs related to the state stack also emerged, especially when the user pressed Escape during transitions, which occasionally resulted in the wrong state being displayed or prematurely closed. Another difficulty was testing the UI interactions, as Pygame lacks strong support for simulating input events in a headless testing environment. Additionally, ensuring the tile validation logic correctly prevented re-stepping on tiles or making invalid moves required significant debugging and refinement.

From these challenges, I learned several important lessons. Most notably, implementing a clear and consistent state management system greatly improved code clarity and game flow. Separating concerns by isolating event handling, rendering, and game logic made the project easier to maintain and scale. I also learned the value of testing core logic early in development, as this could have saved considerable time during the debugging phase. Furthermore, simple user feedback—such as on-screen messages when making invalid moves—had a surprisingly large impact on user experience and helped clarify gameplay rules. Lastly, I realized that planning for scalability, such as dynamically loading levels from external files, would make future content creation more efficient. Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience in both game development and project organization.
